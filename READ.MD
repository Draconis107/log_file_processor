Thoughts:
I found this a very interesting technical challenge. Although the overall task was straightforward, it provided a nice opportunity to demonstrate a range of skills and to explore certain technologies more deeply than I typically do in day-to-day development work.

With additional time, I would have explored ways to further optimise the PowerShell scripts for scalability, and also investigated how AWS Lambda could be leveraged to automate generation and hosting of the report.
